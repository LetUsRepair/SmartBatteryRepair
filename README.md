# SB-Hack-Evolved (v0.2.0)

Just started working on this, so the README (and GUI) is incredibly baren currently.

What this is going to become, is a free software for users to easily reset their laptop battery(ies), or laptops that they're working on.

---
Currently, there aren't any (that I know of), free pieces of software, that will **easily** let you work with SMBus (IÂ²C) / batteries, so let's change that ðŸ˜‰

## This repository is based off another GitHub repository
that I found ([link](https://github.com/laszlodaniel/SmartBatteryHack)), but it's quite cumbersome to use, if you don't know **EXACTLY** what you're doing, and it's technical. You'll need to know and understand SMBus registries, reading- and writing commands, encryption, "magic" responses.. and that's just the beginning.

# Why free??

Well; I'm sick and tired of people  and companies that try to twist every possible, last dime, from people who only want to have a working device. I am faar from rich or even well off, I'm just a really! weird guy from Norway, that's not motivated by, or care about money... As long as I can pay may mortgage and put basic food on the table, that's enough for me. (Note: There is a Buy Me A Coffee link below, if you wish to give a cent/dime/pence to, well.. Buy Me A Coffee, but it's absolutely no requirement, nor expected; It's just a way for anyone who wishes, to say "Thank You".)


# More detailed information coming

It's just begun, as mentioned, so I'll get a proper page written up, along the way ðŸ¥°
